# Vision-Track
Developed an object detection system using the YOLOv5 model integrated with OpenCV to identify and classify multiple objects in real-time from images and video streams. The project demonstrates practical applications of deep learning in computer vision and showcases skills in Python, PyTorch, and model inference.
